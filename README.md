# 100-days-of-code
This repository will be used to log my daily coding activities as part of the #100daysofcode challenge. 

### Day 4: 18 August 2022

### Day 3: 17 August 2022

### Day 2: 16 August 2022
Another day of practice on learnjavascript.online. I started off doing some flashcard exercises to recap everything I have worked on the last couple of days. After that I focused on accessing object values dynamically with different .Object methodes and learned new debugging methodes by using Object shorthands.

### Day 1: 15 August 2022
I spent one hour on Javascript exercises via learnjavascript.online. Today I delved into the .reduce() array method and Array destructuring. In addition, I watched several YouTube videos to learn more about collaboration via GitHub.
